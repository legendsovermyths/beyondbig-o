# About Beyond Big-O

**from contest to codebase** — bridging the gap between competitive programming and real-world software development.

## What is this?

Beyond Big-O is a technical blog that explores advanced competitive programming algorithms through the lens of practical software engineering. Each post dives deep into algorithmic concepts with:

- **Rigorous mathematical analysis** — complete proofs and complexity analysis
- **Visual explanations** — diagrams, animations, and interactive examples  
- **Real-world applications** — how these algorithms power modern software
- **Implementation details** — clean, production-ready code examples

## The Philosophy

Competitive programming teaches us to think algorithmically and solve complex problems under constraints. But the journey doesn't end at the contest scoreboard. These same algorithmic insights become the building blocks of scalable systems, efficient databases, and intelligent applications.

This blog explores that connection — showing how contest algorithms evolve into production code, how mathematical elegance translates to engineering excellence, and how competitive programming skills directly enhance software development capabilities.

## For Whom?

This blog is designed for:

- **Competitive programmers** looking to transition into software engineering
- **Software engineers** wanting to deepen their algorithmic knowledge  
- **Computer science students** bridging theory and practice
- **Anyone curious** about the mathematical beauty underlying modern software

## About the Author

Hi! I'm **Anirudh Singh**, a software engineer passionate about the intersection of competitive programming and real-world software development. I believe that the algorithmic thinking developed through contests directly translates to building better, more efficient software systems.

*The name "Beyond Big-O" reflects our journey from complexity analysis to real-world impact. Every algorithm starts with understanding its Big-O notation, but its true value lies in how it performs beyond the theoretical bounds — in production systems, at scale, under real constraints.*
